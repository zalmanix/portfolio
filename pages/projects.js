                    further developed by my team for two months but we abbadoned the project for another one after failing to cash it. So if you are intrested in publishing our game
                    conact me via email. Game is real time strategy with resources like humans, wood and power and tiles upgrades, better dams to protect your little civilisation against
                    scary tsunami waves. Your goal is to leave this broken planet and seek shelter in the space."

                    from the ground up by me. I'm very proud of this project of my, it has 60 diffrent levels in 3 levels of difficulty (20 for each level). Game features a special
                    game mode that gradually makes levels harder and harder up to Doom eternal full mele playthrough. "
