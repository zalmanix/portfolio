                        content="Japan Scientist Simulator is an indie game made only in 24h in RzeszÃ³w Game Jam, I and my team scored second place. It is made in Godot engine using GDScript. It was further developed by my team for two months but we abandoned the project for another one after failing to cash it. So if you are interested in publishing our game contact me via email. Game is a real-time strategy with resources like humans, wood and power, and tiles upgrades, better dams to protect your little civilization against scary tsunami waves. Your goal is to leave this broken planet and seek shelter in space."

I&apos;m very proud of this project of mine, it has 60 different levels in 3 levels of difficulty (20 for each level). The game features a special
